Introduction to Python for Scientists
=====================================

This course will cover the basics of Python programming and provide
introductions to using the most important concepts and modules for
data processing and data analysis, including numpy for processing
large amounts of data; scipy for optimization, mathematical functions,
and statistics; matplotlib for plotting; scikit-learn for
machine-learning methods.

This course is being taught at Northern Arizona University, Department
of Physics and Astronomy, in the 2016 Fall semester.

Timeline for Fall 2016:
-----------------------

  * Sept 2: **no class**
    *homework*: make python work on your computer! Feel free to use an integrated development environment (IDE), but you might as well just use a text editor and a terminal/shell (that's what I usually do).

  * Sept 9: python basics, datatypes, strings, lists
  * Sept 16: more lists, dictionaries, sets
  * Sept 23: control flow, file i/o, modules, exceptions, classes
  * Sept 30: modules, standard libraries: math, os, datetime, urllib2, subprocess
  * Oct 7: **no class**
  * Oct 14: numpy: basics, arrays 
  * Oct 21: **no class**
  * Oct 28: more numpy: structured arrays, file i/o ,random, statistics, linalg
  * Nov 4: matplotlib
  * Nov 11: **no class** (Veteran's Day)
  * Nov 18: scipy
  * Nov 25: **no class** (Thanksgiving)
