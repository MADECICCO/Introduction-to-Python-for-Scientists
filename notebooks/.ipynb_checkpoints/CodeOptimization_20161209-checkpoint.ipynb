    "Writing Python code is one thing - writing efficient code is a much different thing. Optimizing your code may take a while; if it takes longer to work on the code than it takes to run it, the additional time spent on optimization is a bad investment. However, if you use that specific piece of code on a daily basis, it might be worth to spend more time on the optimization.\n",

Consider the following example in which the integral over a function is determined using the quadrature rule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration#Quadrature_rules_based_on_interpolating_functions):"
